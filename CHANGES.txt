(unreleased; supports Zope 3.4/Zope 2.11/ZODB 3.8, also unreleased)

- adjust to BTrees changes in ZODB 3.8 (thanks Jürgen Kartnaller)

1.0.1
=====

(supports Zope 3.3/Zope 2.10/ZODB 3.7)

- Incorporated test and bug fix from Gabriel Shaar::

  if the target parameter is a container with no objects, then
  `shared.AbstractContainer.isLinked` resolves to False in a bool context and
  tokenization fails.  `target and tokenize({'target': target})` returns the
  target instead of the result of the tokenize function.

- Made README.txt tests pass on hopefully wider set of machines (this was a
  test improvement; the relationship index did not have the fragility).
  Reported by Gabriel Shaar.
