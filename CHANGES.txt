1.0.1
-----

- Incorporated test and bug fix from Gabriel Shaar::

    if the target parameter is a container with no objects, then
    `shared.AbstractContainer.isLinked` resolves to False in a bool context and
    tokenization fails.  `target and tokenize({'target': target})` returns the
    target instead of the result of the tokenize function.

- Made README.txt tests pass on hopefully wider set of machines (this was a
  test improvement; the relationship index did not have the fragility).
  Reported by Gabriel Shaar.
